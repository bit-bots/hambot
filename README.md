# Hambot
Mechanical parts of the open source robot Hambot. It is designed to be a low cost robot which is especially useful for RoboCup Soccer.

This is version 1.0.
Only the .stl files for the 3D printed parts are in this git. For the original Darwin parts visit: http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwinop/

The electronics are in seperated gits:

We will test this version in the next weeks in the RoboCup competetions IranOpen and GermanOpen. There is no assembly manual yet but it will be done for version 1.1 which will be released in may.
